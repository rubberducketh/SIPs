## Simple Summary

Specifies the structure and mandate of the grantsDAO

## Abstract

Synthetix grantsDAO is a decentralized organization part of the the Synthetix protocol that governs the process of funding projects that contribute to the adoption of Synthetix.

## Motivation

grantsDAO was initially set up through SIP-39 - https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-39. This SIP expands by further specifying the foundational structure of the organization as well as its mandate. 

## Specification

### Democracy and Epoch Length

The grantsDAO consists of 5 nominees who are voted in by the Synthetix token holders for a period of 3 months, following the same weighted model as used by the Spartan Council of "1 identity = N votes" described in SIP-90 https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-90.

grantsDAO proposals and initiatives will be voted on by grantsDAO members, where members are assigned 1 vote each.

### Scope

The grantsDAO is responsible for managing grants and leading initiatives.

- The scope of managing grants includes: 

  - Defining processes for submitting a grant proposal request
  - Guiding applicants through the required processes
  - Interviewing applicants and evaluating proposals
  - Voting on proposals and distributing approved funds

- The scole of leading initiatives:
  - Management of hackathons and bounty competitions
  - Voting on submissions and distributing approved funds

- General responsibilities include:
  - Maintaining budget in a multisig contract
  - Liaising with other Synthetix DAO bodies and contributors when necessary Communicating and marketing

- The grantsDAO is not obligated to:
  - Perform any work related to the execution of a funded project, that includes writing a proposal, development, or maintaining of a delivered product. (The DAO may decide to assist on these). 
  - Spend its budget, if it deems there are currently no useful proposals or initiatives.
  
### Deliverables

  - Establishment of operations, processes and communication channels
  - Organization of initiatives
  - Evaluation of grant proposals

### Funding

grantsDAO's submits a budget proposal for approval to synthetixDAO for each quarter. The funding from synthetixDAO is discretionary.

Having a grants organization allows the protocol to incentivize talented individuals or team to contribute to the growth of Synthetix ecosystem. Having a DAO govern the process adds transparency to the decision-making and is one of the outputs of Synthetixâ€™s shift to decentralised governance.
